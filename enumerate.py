# "Twinkle, twinkle, little star",
#       Twinkle Twinkle litte star
#            Up above the world so high,
#       Like a diamond in the sky.

#     When the blazing sun is gone,
#     When he nothing shines upon,
#     Then you show your little light,
#     Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

#            Then the traveler in the dark
#            Thanks you for your tiny spark,
#            How could he see where to go,
#         If you did not twinkle so?

#    In the dark blue sky you keep,
#    Often through my curtains peep
#    For you never shut your eye,
#    Till the sun is in the sky.

# As your bright and tiny spark
# Lights the traveler in the dark,
# Though I know not what you are,
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
